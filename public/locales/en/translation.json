        "first": "We are distributors of honey produced solely and exclusively by the Canarian Black Bee, an endemic breed that we try to increase awareness of.",
        "second": "From the region of Granadilla de Abona, in the south of Tenerife, we develop this activity with the help of different beekeepers from all over the Canary Islands. Our experience in the industry over the years has given us enough knowledge to enable us to select the highest quality honey.",
        "third": "Our honey is not additionally treated after being extracted from the hive. It is packaged and made available immediately to our customers. In addition, we work with multiple containers and types of honey, and, depending on the season and location, we have different varieties."

        "first": "The greatest treasure that beekeeping possesses in the Canary Islands is its breed of bees, an indigenous breed. The Canarian Black Bee split some 200,000 years ago from a common origin that links it with African and Portuguese bees, and it has developed genetic characteristics that make it unique in the world.",
        "second": "Like most of the wildlife belonging to the Canary Islands, the Canarian Black Bee is the result of centuries of isolation in the process of evolution and adaptation to the environment, forming an integral part of the specific biodiversity of the Canary Islands.",
        "third": "Bees play a crucial role in pollination on our planet. By promoting the consumption of local honey, we promote the beekeeping activity and therefore, we have a positive influence on our environment. We also help protect an indigenous species, our bee. In addition, honey is a product that contains antioxidants, vitamins and minerals, as well as being antimicrobial and antiseptic, so it can be used instead of sugar as a more healthy alternative."
